# Evaluation of matching systems on the reference alignment (EQ)

The files in this folder represent the alignments (rdf/xml) computed by AgreementMakerLight, LogMap and YAM++. 

In addition, an Excel spreadsheet (Evaluation Matching Systems.xlsx) is provided as a more reader-friendly version of the alignment files and the equivalence reference alignment they are evaluated against.
